# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study – Robinhood – John Bilsel

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company:

Robinhood

* When was the company incorporated?: 

Robinhood was founded on the 18th of April, 2013 (9 years ago). 

* Who are the founders of the company? 

The founders of Robinhood are Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhaat, who were Stanford roommates.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

Vlad and Baiju already had a history of building “high frequency trading” platforms for financial institutions in NYC prior to the launch of Robinhood. They set out with a mission to democratise trading and access to financial markets, rather than keeping it restricted to the wealthy. The founders wanted to disrupt the brokerage industry by creating a no-fee, easy to use trading application, whilst also aiming to educate their customers along the way.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Robinhood was funded privately through seed and series rounds between December 2013 and January 2021 by venture capitalists, institutional investors, and angel investors:

1.	Seed - $3m
2.	Series A - $13m
3.	Series B - $50m
4.	Series C - $110m
5.	Series D - $363m
6.	Series E - $373m
7.	Series F - $280m
8.	Series G - $660m
9.	Series G (2) - $3.4bn


On the 29th of July 2021, Robinhood launched their IPO and were officially listed on the NASDAQ. Robinhood initially listed at $38 on the day of its IPO with the two founders keeping a majority stake collectively in the stock.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

One specific financial problem that Robinhood may be trying to solve is the high cost of investing, which can be a barrier to entry for many people who are interested in the stock market but don't have a lot of money to invest. By offering commission-free trading, Robinhood is trying to make it easier and more affordable for people to invest in the stock market and grow their wealth over time.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The company's intended customers are individuals who are interested in investing in the stock market but may not have a lot of money to invest or may be put off by the high cost of traditional brokerage services. This may include a younger demographic, primarily within their 20’s or 30’s who are recently getting into investing.




Here is a trend of Robinhood’s user base in millions:

The main key solution that is offered that competitors struggle with is commission-free trading which they are able to achieve by selling their “order-flow” to market makers such as Citadel. What tis essentially means is that Citadel are willing to pay for Robinhood’s book of buy and sell orders in the hope to achieve some sort of financial game through arbitrage or profiting off the spread between buy and sell orders. It allows market makers to see the orders that come into the market, and therefore can make amendments to their trading strategies accordingly. They can therefore gain additional information about the book of orders which allows them to exploit any tiny inefficiency.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Robinhood are considered a relatively innovative company in the brokerage space and therefore make use of very complex and new technologies. A few areas which are covered by these technologies are developing advanced algorithms, data analysis, storage, and power.

The primary technologies used by Robinhood are:
1.	Cloud Computing, to host its data and applications and scale its services efficiently to meet the demand from a growing client base. Specifically, Robinhood’s data stack is hosted on AWS and the way they implement it is through (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) – a tool for powering analytics and search.
2.	Machine learning and AI would be a huge part of Robinhood’s process. This can be used to understand their customers and provide real-time insight based on a customer’s behaviour or profile. Machine learning would also be instrumental within their market data analysis and developing the core infrastructure (training and serving platform, feature platform). These machine learning techniques are implemented through programming software’s such as Python and C++.
3.	App Development. Since this is their product, a heavy load of programming would be used to develop the actual app and maintain it. There would be an overlap with AI in this space of technology, too. These app development techniques are implemented through programming software’s such as Python and C++.
4.	Cryptocurrency. Robinhood offer crypto trading, which comes with the need to be able to securely store and manage those assets. Robinhood have their own separate entity where crypto trading is done - through an account with Robinhood Crypto, LLC. Robinhood Financial, LLC and Robinhood Crypto, LLC are wholly owned subsidiaries of Robinhood Markets, Inc.

In relation to their data management, demand, and trading services, Robinhood were under the pump post COVID when the app become very popular. In order to manage the bucket loads of interest in the app, Robinhood utilised something called sharding at the application layer and not just the database. Sharding is essentially splitting a huge dataset into smaller portions. Therefore, they were able to manage their vast array of users – having their own application servers, database, and deployment pipeline. 






## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Robinhood operate in the domain of the brokerage business – in the investment and trading industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The key point for this question is accessibility and affordability. Over the last 5-10 years, there have been several major trends and innovations in the brokerage industry. Some of these include the rise of low-cost and commission-free trading platforms, the increasing popularity of mobile trading apps, the growth of alternative trading platforms and services such as robo-advisors, and the expanding use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the trading and analytics process.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

-	Fidelity, Superhero, Commsec, E-toro, CMC Markets

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Robinhood has certainly disrupted the brokerage business by offering a very cost-efficient, game-like way to invest your money, without a minimum requirement. This has led them to taking the majority of market share within the brokerage industry – and forcing competitors to become more relaxed on their pricing. Their proactiveness and ‘ahead of the game’ technological implementation and advancements has created urgency for more traditional style brokers to invest more in technologies and programming solutions. 

There have also been some negative impacts, however. The democratization of investing and trading has left ill-informed retail investors in the mud, to stay the least. The timing of the popularity of Robinhood was interesting, as consumers had tons of QE cheap money from the Fed to spend, though they couldn’t go outside due to lockdowns. This led to a capital market bubble and zero interest rates. Robinhood facilitated an easy entrance for many first-time investors who did not really understand the markets too well and fundamental principles – causing all time high prices in assets. Whilst making finance accessible 


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Given Robinhood is a trading/investing platform that is primarily accessed by retail investors, the main metric that would dictate the success would be the number of users, user retention and new users. Another primary metric that would be used is ‘assets under management’ – showing the amount of money Robinhood are managing for their clients. Robinhood has experienced great growth on these metrics from 2020 (COVID) till approximately end of 2021, when inflation begun, and monetary policy started to begin shifting from loose to tight. This is due to consumers not having the ability o flush their savings into mindless speculation and prioritizing essential goods.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Given Robinhood has taken the majority of market share over the past few years, especially since COVID – and therefore is very much leading competitors in the brokerage space. Currently they hold 28% of the market share, compared to competitors who are following such as Fidelity.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Potentially delving more into DeFi, NFTs and the blockchain would be value accretive for Robinhood as we look into the future demand for these products. Other options could be diversifying globally, as currently they are mainly based and big in the US. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

1.	The demand for NFT, blockchain and DeFi products and accessibility. 
2.	General global demand for free brokerage products – such as EM, Australia and Europe.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

- Exact same as what they currently have, and more international resources.
- On the blockchain side, more development into one of the blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, on ramping and off ramping fiat and cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
- Definitely more AI, machine learning and big data analytics.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

-	They will allow for growth, diversification, and robustness in the general business model of the Robinhood application.
-	Robinhood would also benefit from the increased demand for DeFI and blockchain accessibility.
-	Expanding and gaining more market share.
-	Lowering their cost of capital by proving their ability to provide defensive cash flows moving forward.
